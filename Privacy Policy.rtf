\f1\b0 \

\f0\b 2.1 User Input Data
\f1\b0 \
Our app is a training tool for individuals studying foreign languages.

Any text input provided by users for correction is processed by the ChatGPT API in real-time. We do not store or transmit this user input data to our servers.\

For speech practice, we utilize Google Text-to-Speech. The text provided by users for speech practice is sent to Google's servers for real-time speech synthesis. We do not store or retain this speech practice data. Please note that if these external services, such as ChatGPT and Google Text-to-Speech, are unavailable, new advice cannot be generated.\

We use Apple's built-in analytics to collect anonymized and aggregated usage information. This may include device information, app crashes, and general usage statistics. This data is collected by Apple and is subject to Apple's privacy policy.\
